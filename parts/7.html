    <p>Congratulations! You have now made your own programming language. It's time to take it out for a spin.</p>

    <p>Any programming language with respect for itself needs to have a standard library. This is a collection of useful functions provided along with the language core.</p>

    <p>In this section we will create various useful functions, all implemented purely in the Lisp. No Python this time!</p>

    <p>For this part, you should consider the provided tests more like suggestions than something you <em>have</em> to follow. It is your language, after all, and you decide what should be in its library.</p>
